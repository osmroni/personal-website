    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>My journey into product management started in environments where ambiguity was the default and decisions had real-life consequences.</p>
    <p>In Unit 8200, I learned how complex systems behave under pressure, and how clarity, ownership, and trust make the difference between good intentions and real outcomes. That experience shaped how I approach product today — with deep respect for systems, data, and the people behind them.</p>
    <p>Over time, I found myself drawn to roles where I could sit between technology and users, translating complexity into usable, scalable solutions.</p>

  <h2>Selected Experiences</h2>

  <p>
    Rather than full case studies, these are a few experiences that shaped how I work
    and think as a product manager:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Leading the replacement of a legacy platform with a modern system that
      tripled its user base and became a core interface for advanced AI models
    </li>
    <li>
      Redefining core data models and specifications to improve scalability,
      consistency, and downstream usability across multiple teams
    </li>
    <li>
      Owning end-to-end delivery of SaaS and data-driven systems used by
      tens of thousands of users across diverse personas
    </li>
    <li>
      Mentoring team leads and product contributors while balancing people leadership
      with hands-on ownership in high-pressure environments
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For deeper dives into my professional work, you can find selected case studies in my

<section id="philosophy">
  <h2>How I Think About Product</h2>

  <p>
    I see product management as the craft of making good decisions under uncertainty.
    My work sits at the intersection of systems thinking, data, and human judgment —
    understanding complex problems deeply before committing to solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I care about clarity: clear problem framing, clear ownership, and clear measures of
    success. In data-heavy and AI-adjacent systems, I’ve learned that the quality of
    decisions often depends less on the tools themselves and more on how well the system
    is designed to support the people using it.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start with the problem, not the feature</strong> — resist premature solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Design for scale, optimize for learning</strong> — especially early.</li>
    <li><strong>Make tradeoffs explicit</strong> — ambiguity is inevitable, confusion is optional.</li>
    <li><strong>Build for humans, not dashboards</strong> — metrics serve decisions, not the other way around.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="learning">
  <h2>What I’m Learning & Exploring</h2>

  <p>
    I’m continuously expanding my understanding of how modern product teams operate
    in complex, data-intensive environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lately, I’ve been spending time exploring:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      How AI-driven systems change product discovery, user expectations,
      and the role of interfaces
    </li>
    <li>
      Data modeling and pipelines as first-class product decisions,
      not just technical implementation details
    </li>
    <li>
      How product managers can better collaborate with research and engineering
      in ambiguous, high-stakes environments
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I treat learning as an ongoing practice — combining hands-on experience,
    structured study, and reflection.
